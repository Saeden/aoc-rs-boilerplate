# Description
This is a simple wrapper to easily do the advent of code puzzles using rust. It reads the input from some text file that is contained in the relevant day folder.

Edit `mod.rs` in any of the `days/dayX` files.

# Usage
Run any of the puzzles by calling:
```bash
cargo run -- <DAY> <PART> <INPUT>
```

Where:
- <DAY> is a number between 1 and 25
- <PART> is either 'a' or 'b'
- <INPUT> is the name of a .txt file contained in the day folder <DAY>
